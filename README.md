## Open Opportunities will be _temporarily_ shutting down

On October 1, Open Opportunities will be temporarily shutting down while the
platform finds a new home. Until now, Open Opportunities has been operated by
18F and owned by the Office of Products and Platforms, both within the General
Services Administration. We’re in the process of transferring operations of Open
Opportunities to a new team, but because of compliance regulations we must pause
use of the platform until then.

We apologize for this interruption in the amazing work all of you are doing with
Open Opportunities. All of the data and current opportunities are saved. We hope
to find a new team to operate the platform soon, and then we will be able to
restore all existing opportunities.

Thank you for your patience during this transition and for working to build a
passionate community working to grow the government’s impact.
